Description: Implements the hybrid framework for event prediction described in Fang & Zheng (2011, <doi:10.1016/j.cct.2011.05.013>). To estimate the survival function the event prediction is based on, a piecewise exponential hazard function is fit to the time-to-event data to infer the potential change points. Prior to the last identified change point, the survival function is estimated using Kaplan-Meier, and the tail after the change point is fit using piecewise exponential.
